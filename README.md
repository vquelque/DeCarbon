# ETH Amsterdam 2022 - DeCarbon

## Short Description

CarbonCleaner: The first service that enables you to compensate your ETH carbon footprint in a single click !

## Long description

Environmental concerns are more important than ever. Each people has its own Co2 footprint.
Similarly to any other technology, Blockchain contributes to the Co2 footprint of each one of us. In the past few years, several services for compensating Co2 emissions emerged.
We propose the first one-click Co2 compensation service for Ethereum. We partner with patch.io to offset the carbon emissions.
Our interface enables you to connect your Ethereum wallet using WalletConnect. We compute the total amount of Co2 emitted by transaction sent from your account. Then, using a single click, you can choose to compensate your Ethereum Co2 footprint which will redirect you to a payment page. Unfortunately, our partner is curently limited to FIAT payments and does not yet support crypto payments. However, we are confident we will be able to negotiate with them in the near future so that they accept native crypto payments :) !
Finally, we issue an amazing modern crypto-art NFT on Polygon ðŸ˜Ž, that can be traded on a secondary market ðŸš€, certifying that you sucessfully offset your Co2 emissions !
You can also download your official patch.io certificate which you will also receive via email.
